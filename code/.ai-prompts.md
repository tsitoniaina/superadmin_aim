#  App.jsx

In `App.jsx` , when there is session data, I currently render a text displaying the username and a logout button.
But I fetch user data from a server and I would like to elements fron that fetch, such as "last_sign_in_at" and "email".
Propose me the modifications to the code in order to display these elements.

# Rotate TAble

In `UserDataTable`, the table is horizontally oriented. 
I would like to rotate it so that it is vertically oriented.
Propose me the new code for the table. 
Answe with the whole new `user-data-table.jsx` file.


# Planet links as button with rounded corners

In `./src/components/user-data-view.jsx`, the planet links are currently displayed as simple text links.
I would like to display them as buttons with rounded corners.
Propose me a modified version of `./src/components/user-data-view.jsx` that displays the planet links as buttons with rounded corners.

# Planet links as colored buttons depending on `planet.status`

In `./src/components/user-data-view.jsx`, 
the planet links are currently displayed as rounded corner buttons, but they are all the same color.
I want the color to be different depending on the `planet.status` value. Possible values are `true` and `false`.
If `planet.status` is `true`, the button should be green. If `planet.status` is `false`, 
the button should be red and the link should be disabled.
